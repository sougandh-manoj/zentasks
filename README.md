# ZenTasks üéØ

### Project Description
Built for the Useless Projects, this is productivity website that's given up on productivity. It combines professional-grade design with deliberately chaotic functionality, creating an experience that's simultaneously frustrating and delightfully entertaining. It's technically impressive, visually stunning, and completely useless‚Äîexactly perfect for this hackathon.
