# ZenTask üéØ

### Project Description
Built for the Useless Projects hackathon, this is productivity software that's given up on productivity. It combines professional-grade design with deliberately chaotic functionality, creating an experience that's simultaneously frustrating and delightfully entertaining. It's technically impressive, visually stunning, and completely useless‚Äîexactly perfect for this hackathon.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People Were Actually Completing Their Tasks

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So i created Checkboxes that flee on sight, ensuring zero completion rates
