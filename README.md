# ZenTask 🎯

### Project Description
Built for the Useless Projects, this is productivity website that's given up on productivity. It combines professional-grade design with deliberately chaotic functionality, creating an experience that's simultaneously frustrating and delightfully entertaining. It's technically impressive, visually stunning, and completely useless—exactly perfect for this hackathon.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People Were Actually Completing Their Tasks

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So i created Checkboxes that flee on sight, ensuring zero completion rates

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- React,vite
- Tailwind CSS, tailwindcss-animate
- TypeScript ESLint

# Installation
npm i

# Run
npm run dev

### Project Documentation
For Software:   A beautifully crafted productivity app that's professionally designed to make you completely unproductive. Watch checkboxes run away from your cursor and tasks                  self-destruct after one hour. It's like productivity, but in reverse—and somehow more satisfying.
